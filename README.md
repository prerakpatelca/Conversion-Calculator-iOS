# Conversion-Calculator-iOS
iOS application that converts temperature from C to F and vice versa. It converts currency from USD to CAD and vice versa. It also converts distance from miles to kms and vice versa.

The user can enter a value on each tab and press either convert button to be presented with
the converted value. On each tab, I have used a gesture recognizer to allow the user to dismiss the keyboard by
tapping the background.
The app has 3 tabs that look approximately like below. There is also a label on each tab under the 2nd
button. This label is used to display the results of the conversions.
